Welcome to my **LeetCode Journey**!  
This repository documents my practice of solving LeetCode problems using **Java**.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and build consistency through coding.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Problems are organized by topic for easier navigation:




---

## 🎯 Goals
- Solve problems consistently to build strong DSA fundamentals  
- Write clean, optimized, and well-commented code  
- Track progress and create a personal reference library  
- Explore multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)  

---

## 📈 Progress Tracker
- ✅ Arrays  
- ✅ Strings  
- ⏳ Linked List  
- ⏳ Trees  
- ⏳ Dynamic Programming  
- ⏳ Graphs  

*(I’ll update this as I go along!)*
